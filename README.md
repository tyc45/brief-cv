2nd brief for the Web Developper class at Simplon.co
This is a sample Curriculum Vitae using only HTML for the sake of exercising the basics of HTML structuring.

This was made in the context of a brief which explicitly asked me to not use any styling or script.

It helped me clarify for myself what a clean and functionnal HTML5 structure should look and be built like and I learned a lot about basic HTML stuff.
This was also my first time using a boilerplate.

Any comment on anything you see here is welcome! :D
